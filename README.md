# ReadMe-Generator

## Description
    This application prompts and generates professional README markdown files. I built this project to test my knowledge of Node.js
    as well as my ability to incorporate inquirer.js.
    The problem this application helps alleviate is the difficult task of creating a professional readme as a new up and coming 
    developer attempting to submit their portfolios for job applications. 
    I learned a lot more about utilizing inquirer in this project. 
  
## Installation Instructions
    The only thing that needs to be installed for this application is going to be NodeJS. Included here will be a link to
    instructions on how to properly install Node.

    coding bootcamp team that provided said starter code.
